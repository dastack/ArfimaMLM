Description: ArfimaMLM provides functions to facilitate the estimation of ARFIMA-MLM for repeated cross-sectional data and pooled cross-sectional time series data. The estimation procedure uses double filtering with ARFIMA methods to account for autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of multilevel modeling (MLM) to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters simultaneously.
