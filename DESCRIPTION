Description: ArfimaMLM provides functions to facilitate the estimation of ARFIMA-MLM for repeated cross-sectional data. The estimation procedure uses double filtering with ARFIMA methods to account for autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of multilevel modeling (MLM) to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters simultaneously.
